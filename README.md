# Data Files

* monkey1.mat and monkey2.mat
  include both monkeys' behavioral and neural recording data for our noninear choice correlation tests. 

* monkey1_filter.mat and monkey2_filter.mat

  include monkeys' data sampled according to similar data quality. It was generated by FigureR1.ipynb and used by Figure_R1CDE_DataQualityControl.m

* monkey1_conditioned_nuisance.mat and monkey2_conditioned_nuisance.mat

  include monkeys' data conditioned on the orientation nuisance. It was generated by FigureS5AB.ipynb and used by FigureS5C_GenerateData.m

* CC_Pvalue_Conditioned_Data.mat

  include Choice correlation analysis data based on monkey1_conditioned_nuisance.mat and monkey2_conditioned_nuisance.mat. It was generated by FigureS5C_GenerateData.m and used by FigureS5C_Plotting.nb.
